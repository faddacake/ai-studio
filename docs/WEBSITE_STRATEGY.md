# AI Studio Website Strategy

## Target User
Creators and solo entrepreneurs who generate AI content (images, video, text) and want to move from scattered SaaS tools to a single, self-hosted workflow builder. They value privacy, cost control, and repeatability.

## Positioning
**AI Studio** is the self-hosted AI workflow studio. One Docker container, your API keys, full privacy. Build pipelines, run multi-model comparisons, control costs — without vendor lock-in.

Key differentiators vs. SaaS alternatives:
- **Self-hosted**: Data never leaves your machine
- **BYO keys**: Pay providers directly, no markup
- **Workflow engine**: Chain steps into repeatable pipelines, not one-off generations
- **Multi-model comparison**: Same prompt, multiple models, side-by-side results
- **Cost control**: Budget caps, per-run estimates, usage dashboard

## Information Architecture

## Primary CTA & Funnel

1. **Landing page** → "Buy License" button → `/pricing`
2. **Pricing page** → "Buy Now" → Stripe Checkout (POST `/api/billing/checkout`)
3. **Stripe success** → `/billing/success` with license key delivery instructions
4. **Install** → Docker compose + set LICENSE_KEY
5. **First run** → `/setup` (create password) → `/login` → `/workflows`
6. **Onboarding** → Getting Started checklist in sidebar

Secondary CTA: "Install Guide" → `/docs` for users who already have a license.
