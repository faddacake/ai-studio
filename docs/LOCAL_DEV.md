# Local Development

## Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- (Optional) Node.js 22 + pnpm 9 for running outside Docker

## Quick start

```bash
# Clone and enter the repo
cd ai-studio

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start everything (Next.js + Redis)
docker compose up --build
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:3001**.

## Environment variables

| Variable     | Default                  | Description                                       |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `APP_PORT`   | `3001`                   | Host port mapped to the container                  |
| `PORT`       | `3000`                   | Internal Next.js port (inside container)           |
| `REDIS_URL`  | `redis://redis:6379`     | Redis connection URL                               |
| `DATA_DIR`   | `/data`                  | Persistent data directory (SQLite, assets, config) |
| `NODE_ENV`   | `development`            | Node environment                                   |
| `LOG_LEVEL`  | `info`                   | Logging level (debug, info, warn, error)           |

## Common commands

```bash
# Start in background
docker compose up -d --build

# View logs (follow)
docker compose logs -f app

# Restart after code changes (usually auto-reloads via Next.js HMR)
docker compose restart app

# Full rebuild (after dependency changes)
docker compose up --build --force-recreate

# Stop everything
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (resets data)
docker compose down -v
```

## Confirm the app is healthy

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","db":"connected","timestamp":"..."}
```

Or check compose service health:

```bash
docker compose ps
# Look for "(healthy)" next to the app service
```

## Overriding the host port

If port 3001 is already in use, set `APP_PORT` in your `.env` or inline:

```bash
APP_PORT=3002 docker compose up --build
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port conflict

```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :3001

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>

# Or just use a different port
APP_PORT=3002 docker compose up --build
```

### Stale node_modules

The `node_modules` volume is anonymous to avoid syncing host modules into the container. If dependencies get out of sync:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

### Turbo cache issues

```bash
# Clear turbo cache inside the container
docker compose exec app rm -rf /tmp/.turbo
docker compose restart app
```

## Running outside Docker

If you prefer running directly on your host:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start Redis (required)
docker compose up redis -d

# Set env vars
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
export DATA_DIR=./data

# Start dev servers
pnpm dev
```

This runs `turbo dev`, which starts:
- `apps/web` — Next.js dev server on port 3000
- `packages/worker` — BullMQ worker process

## CI & Branch Protection

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) defines three jobs:

| Job | What it runs | Trigger |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `ci` | Lint, typecheck, unit tests, build | Every push / PR |
| `a11y` | Playwright fixture tests + axe-core WCAG scan | After `ci` passes |
| `e2e` | Full Playwright end-to-end tests against a live Next.js instance | After `ci` passes |

### Required status checks (manual GitHub setup)

To prevent regressions from being merged while checks are failing, pending, or skipped, configure the following as **required status checks** on the `master` branch:

1. Go to **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules → master**.
2. Enable **Require status checks to pass before merging**.
3. Add all three jobs as required: `ci`, `a11y`, `e2e`.
4. Enable **Require branches to be up to date before merging** to prevent stale-branch bypasses.
5. Do **not** enable "Allow bypassing required pull request checks" for any role.

This configuration lives in GitHub repository settings, not in the repo itself, so it must be applied manually after the repo is created or transferred.
