/**
 * Budget enforcement E2E orchestration test.
 *
 * Verifies that when a run has a budget cap configured:
 * - nodes dispatch and execute normally before the cap is reached
 * - once cumulative cost reaches the enforced limit, the run transitions to budget_exceeded
 * - remaining pending nodes are cancelled and never dispatched
 * - downstream nodes of uncompleted branches are cancelled
 * - work that completed before the cap was hit remains preserved
 * - final run state, node states, totalCost, and event stream match system conventions
 *
 * Graph topology:
 *
 *                         ┌── worker (cost: 0.50 → triggers cap)
 *   source (cost: 0) ─────┤
 *                         └── pricey (cost: 0.60) ── blocked
 *
 * Budget cap: $0.50 (= worker cost exactly — exercises the >= boundary).
 *
 * Execution sequence:
 *   1. source completes (totalCost: 0.00)
 *   2. worker and pricey both become ready; worker is dispatched first (loop order)
 *   3. worker completes (totalCost: 0.50 ≥ cap) → cancelPendingNodes → pricey + blocked cancelled
 *   4. outer dispatch loop skips pricey (already cancelled)
 *   5. run status → budget_exceeded; pricey and blocked never execute
