# Claude Developer Prompt — AI Studio

Always check docs/BUILD_STATUS.md before starting any task.

Before doing any work:

1. Read `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md`
2. Assume the architecture described there is correct
3. Do NOT re-audit the repository

## Development Rules

- Extend existing architecture
- Avoid parallel systems
- Prefer modifying existing modules
- Keep code strongly typed (TypeScript)

## Token Efficiency Rules

Do NOT:
- scan the entire repository
- restate architecture
- output unnecessary explanations

Only inspect files required for the task.

## Output Format

Always return:

Files Added  
Files Modified  
Summary  
Next Recommended Task
